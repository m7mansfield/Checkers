Checkers - In C++
--
This program was written in my second section
of introductory CompSci classes, and I am particularly
proud to be one of the students to get it working pretty
darn well. This code is in the public domain because who cares.
The game class however was from our textbook, but I modified quite
a bit. Just don't copy it if you use this repository,
write your own from it.
